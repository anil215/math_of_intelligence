    "Classification and Regression Trees or CART for short is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can used for classification or regression predictive modeling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim at each stage is to associate specific targets (i.e., desired output values) with specific values of a particular variable.The result is a decision-tree in which each path identifies a combination of values associated with a particular prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each non-leaf node in this tree is basically a decision maker. These nodes are called decision nodes. Each node carries out a specific test to determine where to go next. Depending on the outcome, you either go to the left branch or the right branch of this node. We keep doing this until we reach a leaf node. If we are constructing a classifier, each leaf node represents a class. Let’s say you are trying to determine whether or not it’s going to rain tomorrow based on three factors available today — temperature, pressure, and wind. So a typical decision tree would look like this:\n",

    "But how do we construct the optimal tree? What attribute should be at the root node? How do we decide the thresholds? \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Gini Index as our cost function used to evaluate splits in the dataset. We minimize it.\n",

    "A split in the dataset involves one input attribute and one value for that attribute. It can be used to divide training patterns into two groups of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gini score gives an idea of how good a split is by how mixed the classes are in the two groups created by the split. A perfect separation results in a Gini score of 0, whereas the worst case split that results in 50/50 classes in each group results in a Gini score of 1.0 (for a 2 class problem).\n",
